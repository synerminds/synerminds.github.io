This is a short blog about the troubleshooting process we had to face when
assembling and configuring the Car kit with the Raspberry Pi. We hope it can be useful for everyone, specially for those who are doing it alone and with a limited knowledge of how
the raspberry pi works.

### Batteries

When we first start reading the manual to get an idea of how to start assembling the Car, we soon realized that the batteries which are actually needed to give the Car the energy it requires to be started were not included in the package at all.

Please be aware of this before purchasing the kit, so make sure you do buy the batteries (x2) required for this kit. It will save you a lot of time and headaches. 

### Copper Standoffs

Please be extremely careful when placing the M2.5*8 Copper Standoffs on the acrylic (Upper) plate. This is because the plate can be broken easily if too much force is applied. 

Make sure you take your time when assembling this part. 

### Copper Standoffs Screws

Unfortunately, we got the wrong 4 M3*8 [screws](/assets/wrong_screws.png) when it was time to assemble this section. We had to come up with a workaround for this section by using a different set of screws. Please make sure to try the screws first before assembling the Copper Standoffs, this can save you a lot of time.

### Client and Server scripts

Please make sure to download the latest version of the repository code [here](https://github.com/sunfounder/Sunfounder_Smart_Video_Car_Kit_for_RaspberryPi).

### Calibration Configuration

Once you have come to this step, you will need to calibrate properly the Car by following the calibration menu.

## Conclusion

We hope the above information can be useful to you when configuring your own Car kit.

In the next blog we will be talking about how to assemble and configure the Raspberry Pi from scratch. Also, we will be creating a basic first script to print information on the console.
